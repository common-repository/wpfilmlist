== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Does WPFilmList work for both Movies & TV Shows?** - Yes! If it can be found at <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">The Movie Database</a>, it can be found by WPFilmList.

**Why does it take a few seconds for each search?** - When adding a title, you might find that it takes a few seconds for the search results to return. This is because WPFilmList is pulling in a large amount of data about every search result. Fret not however, because once the search completes, you can add multiple titles from the same search at the same time.

**Why can't WPFilmList find my Movie or TV Show??** - While WPFilmList will have no problem finding the vast majority of Movies or TV Shows, occasionally WPFilmList will come across a title that it simply can't find information for. WPFilmList searches through <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">The Movie Database</a> for information about a title, so the general rule of thumb is that if it can't be found at <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">The Movie Database</a>, WPFilmList will not be able to pull information for your title. 

**How do I keep visitors from modifying my library?** - On the WordPress Dashboard you'll see the WPFilmList icon (a white circle outlined in light blue) on the left-hand side. Click on that, which will take you to the WPFilmList Options page. Find the section titled "Display Options". Here you can set many different display options, including whether or not you'd like to "Hide the Edit and Delete Options". Checkmark that checkbox, click 'Save Changes', and the 'Edit' and 'Delete' links will be gone from your library, making it impossible for visitors to modify your library.

**Do you provide support for WPFilmList?** - Absolutely! As this plugin is a fairly new creation, there are bound to be bugs and issues that I haven't come across yet, so please, if there's something just not right about your wpfilmlist experience, shoot me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:jake@jakerevans.com">Jake@jakerevans.com</a>.  

**What are all of the Shortcode Options for displaying a Movie or TV Show?** - To display the cover image of a Movie or TV Show, simply place this shortcode on a page or post: [showbookcover]. The available options are as follows:

**[showfilmcover]** - Shortcode for displaying an individual entry. The options below only apply to the [showfilmcover] shortcode, and not the [wpfilmlist_shortcode] shortcode.

* Specify a movie/tv show: title="xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
* Set alignment: align="left" or align="right"
* Specify library: table="nameoflibrary" (leave out completely to use default library)
* Set the size: width="100"
* Set as Amazon Image link: amazon="true"
* Display the title: showtitle="true"

*Example* *One:* To display a just an entry (without the title) from your custom 'fantasy' library on the left side of a page or post, with a size of 150, this shortcode would do the trick: 

**[showfilmcover title="Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" align="left" width="150" table="fantasy”]**

*Example* *Two:* To display an entry from the default library, as an Amazon Image link, on the right side of a page or post, with a size of 200, with the title displayed below the image, this shortcode would do the trick: 

**[showfilmcover title="Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" align="right" width="200" amazon="true" showtitle="true”]**
